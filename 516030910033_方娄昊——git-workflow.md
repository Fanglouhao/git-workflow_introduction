# Brief Introduction Of Git-workflow
> a great choice to use git in a consistent and productive manner.
## What is a git-workfow?
__Git-workflow__ is a __workflow__ to enhance the effectiveness of a team by using __git__.
>1. __workflow__: a workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of business activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, declared as work of a person or group, an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.From a more abstract or higher-level perspective, workflow may be considered a view or representation of real work. The flow being described may refer to a document, service or product that is being transferred from one step to another.Workflows may be viewed as one fundamental building block to be combined with other parts of an organization's structure such as information technology, teams, projects and hierarchies. ------reference from wikipedia.
>2. __git__: Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. ------reference from wikepedia
### some importants points
1. this workflow scale with team size
1. it is easy to undo mistakes and errors woth this workflow
1. doesn't impose any new unnessary cognitive overhead to the team
## Why we choose git-workflow
__Let's take the most common git-workflow --- centralized for example__
1. Git workflows encourage users to leverage Git effectively and consistently. Git offers a lot of flexibility in how users manage changes. 
1. the Centralized Workflow uses a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all changes to the project.
1. gives every developer their own local copy of the entire project. This isolated environment lets each developer work independently of all other changes to a project - they can add commits to their local repository and completely forget about upstream developments until it's convenient for them.
1. it gives you access to Git’s robust branching and merging model. Unlike SVN, Git branches are designed to be a fail-safe mechanism for integrating code and sharing changes between repositories. The Centralized Workflow is similar to other workflows in its utilization of a remote server-side hosted repository that developers push and pull form. Compared to other workflows, the Centralized Workflow has no defined pull request or forking patterns. A Centralized Workflow is generally better suited for teams migrating from SVN to Git and smaller size teams.
## How it works?
__Let's take the most common git-workflow --- centralized workflow for example__
### 1. Initialize the central reposistory 
First, someone needs to create the central repository on a server. If it’s a new project, you can initialize an empty repository. Otherwise, you’ll need to import an existing Git or SVN repository.

Central repositories should always be bare repositories (they shouldn’t have a working directory), which can be created as follows:

ssh user@host git init --bare /path/to/repo.git

Be sure to use a valid SSH username for user, the domain or IP address of your server for host, and the location where you'd like to store your repo for /path/to/repo.git. Note that the .git extension is conventionally appended to the repository name to indicate that it’s a bare repository.

### 2. Hosted central repositories
Central repositories are often created through 3rd party Git hosting services like __Bitbucke Cloud__ or __Bitbucket Server__. The process of initializing a bare repository discussed above is handled for you by the hosting service. The hosting service will then provide an address for the central repository to access from your local repository.
### 3. Clone the central repository
Next, each developer creates a local copy of the entire project. This is accomplished via the __git clone__ command:

git clone ssh://user@host/path/to/repo.git

When you clone a repository, Git automatically adds a shortcut called __origin__ that points back to the “parent” repository, under the assumption that you'll want to interact with it further on down the road.
### 4. Make changes and commit
Once the repository is cloned locally, a developer can make changes using the standard Git commit process: edit, stage, and commit. If you’re not familiar with the staging area, it’s a way to prepare a commit without having to include every change in the working directory. This lets you create highly focused commits, even if you’ve made a lot of local changes.
```
git status # View the state of the repo
git add <some-file> # Stage a file
git commit # Commit a file</some-file>
```
Remember that since these commands create local commits, John can repeat this process as many times as he wants without worrying about what’s going on in the central repository. This can be very useful for large features that need to be broken down into simpler, more atomic chunks.
### 5. Push new commits to central repository
Once the local repository has new changes committed. These change will need to be pushed to share with other developers on the project.

```
git push origin master
```

This command will push the new committed changes to the central repository. When pushing changes to the central repository, it is possible that updates from another developer have been previously pushed that contain code which conflict with the intended push updates. Git will output a message indicating this conflict. In this situation, git pull will first need to be executed. This conflict scenario will be expanded on in the following section.
### 6. Managing conflicts
The central repository represents the official project, so its commit history should be treated as sacred and immutable. If a developer’s local commits diverge from the central repository, Git will refuse to push their changes because this would overwrite official commits.

![picture2](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:d06191e3-994e-453a-8ea9-a2e93374e53e/03%20(4).svg?cdnVersion=ht)

Before the developer can publish their feature, they need to fetch the updated central commits and rebase their changes on top of them. This is like saying, “I want to add my changes to what everyone else has already done.” The result is a perfectly linear history, just like in traditional SVN workflows.

If local changes directly conflict with upstream commits, Git will pause the rebasing process and give you a chance to manually resolve the conflicts. The nice thing about Git is that it uses the same __git status__ and __git add__ commands for both generating commits and resolving merge conflicts. This makes it easy for new developers to manage their own merges. Plus, if they get themselves into trouble, Git makes it very easy to abort the entire rebase and try again (or go find help).

## Other common workflow
### 1. Forking Workflow
The __Forking Workflow__ is fundamentally different than the other workflows discussed in this tutorial. Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the “central” codebase, it gives every developer a server-side repository. This means that each contributor has not one, but two Git repositories: a private local one and a public server-side one. 
### 2. Feature branching
__Feature Branching__ is a logical extension of Centralized Workflow. The core idea behind the __Feature Branch Workflow__ is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the master branch should never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.
### 3. Gitflow Workflow
The Gitflow Workflow was first published in a highly regarded 2010 blog post from Vincent Driessen at nvie. The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This workflow doesn’t add any new concepts or commands beyond what’s required for the Feature Branch Workflow. Instead, it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact.
